# NDA-Sanity-Check

Final project for the course 'Cloud Technologies' at the University of Warsaw, summer semester 23/24. 

In this repository, you can find the source code for the Frontend and RAG service.

## Project Overview

The project is a tool designed to automate the review of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) to identify and flag clauses that may not meet predefined standards. It uses a combination of feature engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on documents with enterprise-specific standards for NDAs.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: A web application that allows users to upload NDAs and view the results of the analysis.
2. **RAG Service**: A backend service that receives the NDA documents, processes them, and returns the analysis results.
