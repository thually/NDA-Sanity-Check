For each clause/fragment in the input list, the function:\n        - Retrieves the top 3 most similar standards from the KDB using vector search.\n        - Includes the clause/fragment and the retrieved standards into a prompt template for the Large Language Model (LLM).\n\n3. **Run LLM Inference**:\n    - Execute LLM inference on watsonx.ai to generate an answer for each clause/fragment.\n\n4. **Return Results**:\n    - Outputs a list of results containing the corrections and suggestions for each input clause/fragment.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Please enter your credentials needed to start the 'APIclient'.\n\ncredentials = {\n    \"url\": ...,\n    \"apikey\": ...\n}", "execution_count": 4, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import os\nproject_id = os.environ[\"PROJECT_ID\"]", "execution_count": 26, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "from ibm_watsonx_ai import APIClient\n\nclient = APIClient(credentials)\n# Please create a watsonx.ai deployment space, and update the next parameter with the Space UID:\nspace_uid = ...\nclient.set.default_space(space_uid)", "execution_count": 27, "outputs": [{"output_type": "execute_result", "execution_count": 27, "data": {"text/plain": "'SUCCESS'"}, "metadata": {}}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Promote Necessary Assets to the Deployment Space.\n\nThe following assets are promoted to the deployment space to be used in the deployed function\n* The file 'NDA Standards.txt' with the NDA standards\n* LLM Prompt template & instructions"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "promote_files_to_space=['NDA Standards.txt', 'RAG template -
